Yesterday, January 27, 2025, I Alex visited the National Museum in London to see the AI & Robotics exhibit. 
Interestingly, one of the installations referenced a talk by Dr. Emily Carter from January 15, 2025. 
At 3:30 PM, I saw a demonstration that aligned with the discussions we had during the Milan workshop on January 20.
