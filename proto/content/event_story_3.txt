Tomorrow, January 29, 2025, I plan to meet Dr. Emily Carter again at her office in the Cambridge Research Center. 
We will discuss follow-up tasks from the January 20 workshop and the potential of integrating AI & Robotics insights from my visit to the National Museum on January 27. 
In the afternoon, I will finalize the ontology revisions suggested during our Oxford meeting.
