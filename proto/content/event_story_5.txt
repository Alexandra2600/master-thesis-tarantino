On February 1, 2025, I am scheduled to attend the International Conference on Semantic Web Applications in Berlin. 
Dr. Emily Carter will also be presenting her research there. My talk on "Dynamic Knowledge Graphs for Cognitive Support" will include references to the Milan workshop (January 20) and insights from the National Museum exhibit (January 27). 
The networking dinner will be an excellent opportunity to plan future collaborations.
