On January 20, 2025, I hosted a workshop on event-based ontologies at the Milan Innovation Hub, as planned during our lunch at The Eagle and Child. 
Dr. Emily Carter joined the workshop remotely and shared her research on Knowledge Graphs. 
Some of the scenarios we discussed were later integrated into the National Museum exhibit on January 27, 2025.
