On January 15, 2025, I Alex attended a seminar on cognitive technologies at the University of Oxford. 
The lecture, which started at 10:00 AM in Lecture Hall B, was given by Dr. Emily Carter, who later invited me to discuss Knowledge Graph applications. 
During lunch at The Eagle and Child with my colleagues, we decided to collaborate on a workshop about event-based ontologies, planned for January 20, 2025, in Milan.
