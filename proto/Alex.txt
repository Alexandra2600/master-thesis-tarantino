Hi, I'm Alex (alex@example.com), and today I officially started working on my thesis project titled 
"Support System for Alzheimer's Patients". 
The goal is to develop a semantic system to assist Alzheimer's patients in recalling personal information. 
This is a high priority and active project with a due date of 2025/03/25.


Current date: 2025/03/05
Today for my thesis project I have to organize the dataset and define the ontology structure.
Tomorrow I have an appointment scheduled with Professor Senatore (senatore@example.edu) 
at the Engineering Department of the University (123 University St., 40.730610, -73.935242). 
The appointment is set for 10:00 AM, to discuss my approach to the thesis.


Current date: 2025/03/09
Today I must create the first draft of the thesis project and send it to Professor Senatore for feedback. 
This activity has high priority and must be completed by the end of the day.

These are the activities I have to do on 2025/03/12 for my thesis project:

On 2025/03/25 I have scheduled a final discussion event for my thesis project "Support System for Alzheimer's Patients". 
Professor Senatore will attend. The event will occur at the Main Conference Room of the University at 2:00 PM. 
The aim of this meeting is to discuss and decide if any final modifications are necessary before submission.

I would like to start a new, smaller project titled "StudyBuddy App". 
It's an application aimed at assisting children in their studies, scheduled for completion by 2025/06/02. 
For this project, I need to request information from the Department of Computer Science at the University.


Current date: 2025/03/25
Starting today, every day at 15:00 I will have to write the progress report and every day at 09:00 I have to take the dog for a walk to the park.
